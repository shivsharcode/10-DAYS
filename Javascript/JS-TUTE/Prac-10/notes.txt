LECTURE - 12

Synchronous
            Synchronous means the code runs in a partucular sequence of instructions given in the program. 
            Each instruction waits for the prev instruction to complete its execution.

Aynchronous
            Due to synchronous prog., sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes delay in the UI.
            Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
            (1.js)

CallBack
            A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
            (2.js)

CallBack Hell
            Nested Callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. 
            (Pyramid of Doom)
            This style of programming becomes difficult to understand and manage.
            (3.js)

Promises
            Promise is for "eventual" completions of task. It is an object in JS.
            It is a solution to callback hell.
            resolve &  rejcet are callbacks provided by JS.
            3 PromiseState : pending, fulfilled(resolved) , rejected.
            (4,5,6,7.js)

Async-Await
            async function always returns a Promise.
            async function myFunc(){...}
            await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled.
            

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
            IIFE is a function that is called immediately as soon as it is defined
            No need to call it.
            Sirf ek baar hi execute hote hai
            async-await me use hote hai
