Object - A JavaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method)


JS - objects have a special property called prototype

We can set prototype using __proto__

note - If the object and prototype have same method, object's method will be used

Class - class is a program code template for creating objects.
        These objects will have some state(variables) and some behavior (funtions) inside it.

INHERITANCE - Inheritance is passing down properties & methods from parent class to child class
            Method Overriding - If child & parent have same method, child's method will be used
